# SpotifyToAppleMusic
Repository for program that converts spotify library metadata into .csv, then uses .csv to populate apple music library. 

Just a fun little project that I'm sharing for music lovers like myself - this script will help you get the metadata for songs in your spotify library, 
convert it into a csv, and then add songs from the csv to your apple music library. 

Note: 
* Adding to apple music library is a little buggy rn (4/12/2023)
* Script is for creative, educational purposes.
